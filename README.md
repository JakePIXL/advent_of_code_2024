# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 implemented in Rust.

## Project Structure

Each day's solution is organized as a separate Cargo project for simplicity and modularity:

```
advent_of_code/
├── day_one/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main.rs
│   │   └── input.txt
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── .gitignore
├── day_two/
└── ...
```

## Running the Solutions

Each day can be run independently. To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cd day_one
cargo run
```
